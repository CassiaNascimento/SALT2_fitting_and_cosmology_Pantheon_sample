# SALT2_fitting_and_cosmology_Pantheon_sample

Here we have the codes in Python that fit the type Ia Supernovas from the Pantheon sample (Scolnic et al. 2018) using SNCOSMO. The Light-Curves are retrieved from SNANA, the filters undergo decodification and then the SALT2 fitting is performed. We observe the scatter plots between each pair of fiting parameters (x0,x1,c) and the histogram of their distribution, for each survey. We present the figures with the recovered Light-Curves after these process and a cosmologycal analysis is performed considering a universe with Cosmological Constant (\omega=-1) and Cold Dark Matter (i.e. \LambdaCDM). For this analysis we use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) implemented in the Python package EMCEE. A complete likelihood description is used (which according to March et al 2011 leads to biased results in \alpha and \beta. However, the cosmological parameters are not affected). The selection effect is also not corrected, since this step depends on extensive Monte Carlo simulations of every survey. This last bias effect affects both the nuisance parameters (\alpha and \beta) and the cosmological ones.
